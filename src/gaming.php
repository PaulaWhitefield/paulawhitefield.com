<p>Here I will share things related to the games I play.</p>

<h2>What platforms do I play on?</h2>
<p>This is a question I get asked a lot. I own all PlayStations from 1-5, and all the Xboxes from Original to Series X.</p>

<p>I also sometimes play on my laptop using Steam, but most of the time I am playing on one of the above consoles.</p>

<h2>What games do I play and which games are my favourite?</h2>

<p>I don't really have any specific favourites, but I do mostly play game titles by Rockstar Games, with the most played being from their Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption franchises.</p>

<p>Occasionally, you may find me playing other games too, such as Minecraft, and others.</p>

<p>Adjusted the site width and moved some technical info around. Not forgetting more twinkling stars to make it prettier.</p>

<h3>Increased site width to 800px and made it easier to adjust in future</h3>

<p>Previous width was 600 pixels, which when viewed on my larger computer screen looked far too narrow.</p>

<p>Why did I make it 600 in the first place? Did I not see it was too narrow?</p>

<p>No I didn't notice, because I used my tablet computer to develop most of my site, and the screen width on there is smaller, so 600 looked fine.</p>

<p>The width is now <code>800 pixels</code>, which looks better.</p>

<p>Technically, it is defined using the <code>max-width</code> property in CSS, meaning it will not extend beyond 800, but will shrink to the width of the page when viewed on smaller screens.</p>

<p>I would like to thank my friend for explaining this to me, otherwise I would've used the <code>width</code> property which has a much different result for those on smaller screens, and is therefore not very mobile friendly.</p>

<p>On another technical note, I have defined the width as a <code>custom property</code> in CSS, making it easier to adjust in the future should I wish to do so.</p>

<h3>Moved technical info about my site from the footer into the about page</h3>

<p>Not everyone is going to be technical minded enough to care about how I develop my site, but some may be. Which is why I could not remove the info entirely, just needed to find a better place to mention it.</p>

<p>You may have noticed if you have been on my site recently, that there was some technical info about my site displayed at the bottom (footer) of every page. I apologise if this was a turn off for you and caused you to leave my site thinking the site was only for technical people. It's not, so I hope those that left come back soon.</p>

<p>For those that are interested in how my site is made, this info is now displayed in one place, at the bottom of the about page after everything else.</p>

<h3>Changed the lines to be twinking blue stars</h3>

<p>Beforehand, I had solid purple lines separating the different sections of my site. (A styled version of the HR tag in HTML)</p>

<p>I wanted something prettier, so I had a look around for an animated gif of a line, and finally after spending a good hour looking at lines, settled on one with blue twinkling stars.</p>

<p>At least it matches the background being also twinkling stars at the time of writing, so figured it would be a good fit.</p>

<h3>Wrapping things up...</h3>

<p>I would like to thank each and every visitor I get to my website. All of you are amazing, and I give you a virtual hug.</p>

<h2>Music</h2>

<p>Paula isn't into music that much, but sometimes she likes to mess around and make her own music and change things up from her
usual activities, but this is mostly on a rare occasion. In this section, you can see what she uses to play music on, and listen
to some music and audio samples that have been made available.</p>
